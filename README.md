--------------------
EmuParadise - Skip Rom Summary Page
--------------------

Speeds up the process of downloading ROMs from EmuParadise by skipping the ROM summary page.

From the list of ROMs for a chosen platform, the links now take users straight to the download pages instead.

---------------------
Reddit - Comments Tab
---------------------

Simply adds a 'comments' tab to the tab bar (the bar with 'hot', 'new', 'rising'....).
Allows users to see all the latest comments in the current subreddit(s).

Works both with and without RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite).
